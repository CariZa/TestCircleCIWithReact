# TestCircleCIWithReact
Creating a hello world react app to test with Circle CI via a public project

## React.org

Followed the react.org installation information

https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html

I cloned the repo (repo name must be all small case else react's cli throws errors)


Youâ€™ll need to have **Node >= 6** on your machine.

    npm install -g create-react-app
    create-react-app .

    npm start

If you have **npm 5.2.0+** installed, you may use npx instead.

    npx create-react-app .

    npm start
